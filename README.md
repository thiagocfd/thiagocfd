I have been passionate about software development since the moment I typed my first line of code. I am currently majoring in Information Systems at UNIME faculty, where I am also part of the Software Development Center.
I have a great affinity with the back-end and I have been studying and taking courses in C #, .NET and Database (SQL), but I also pay attention to technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I am a multidisciplinary person and I am always looking for new knowledge. I have 10 years of experience as a Physiotherapist and 2 as a Civil Engineer, which today gives me a greater perception of software modeling.
I seek to integrate a development team where I can absorb even more knowledge and be able to contribute to different projects.
